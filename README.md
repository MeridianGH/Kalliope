  - YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and many others!
  - It also supports playlists, livestreams and HTTP sources.
  - Spotify queries will be resolved on YouTube.


- YouTube Search
  - Search up to five songs from YouTube and play one directly from Discord, without ever opening a browser!
  - Playing music in your channel was never this easy.


- Dashboard
  - Use the web dashboard to control your bot without having to type out commands ever again.
  - You can even use your keyboard's built-in music buttons to skip songs and pause or resume playback.


- Genius Lyrics
  - Kalliope supports Genius Lyrics!
  - Quite literally actually, because they are directly accessible in Discord itself via a command.


## Commands

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)**
- **[OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/)** (Java v11 or newer is required. Try the newest version, if you encounter issues use v13)

### Getting started
To install Kalliope, simply download the respective file for your operating system from **[releases](https://github.com/MeridianGH/Kalliope/releases)**.\
On Linux and macOS you'll need to make the file explicitly executable using `chmod`.

If you choose to install Kalliope manually, here's how to do so. Make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MeridianGH/kalliope.git
cd kalliope
npm install
```

### Configuration
Create a file `config.json` in the same directory as your executable and copy the file contents from [<u>`config_example.json`</u>](https://github.com/MeridianGH/Kalliope/blob/main/config_example.json). If you're installing manually, simply rename the file.

Replace the placeholders inside with your info:
- A Discord Bot Token (**[Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)**)
- Your Application ID which you can find in the `General Information` tab in your Discord application.
- Get your YouTube keys like described in this **[Guide](https://github.com/Walkyst/lavaplayer-fork/issues/18)**. Once you have `PAPISID` and `PSID`, set them in the config.
- Create a Genius API application **[here](https://docs.genius.com/)**, generate an access token and paste it in the config.

### Run
Start Kalliope by running the executable using double-click on Windows and `./<filename>` on Linux and macOS.

If you installed Kalliope manually, start the bot with the following command:
```shell
node .
```

If you encounter any errors, make sure you have Java and FFmpeg properly installed.\
Check your Java version using `java --version`.
