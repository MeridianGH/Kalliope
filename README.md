## Disclaimer
> The bot is still in development, so expect some bugs or features that might not work 100% yet. Please report any bugs you encounter by opening an issue.


## Features
- Kalliope still offers full support for almost every platform you can imagine:
  - YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and many others!
  - It also supports playlists, livestreams and HTTP sources.
  - Spotify queries will be resolved on YouTube.

- High quality
  - Kalliope is using the well established **[Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)** library.
  - It allows for high quality playback by hosting its own audio server and streaming directly to Discord.


- YouTube Search
  - Search up to five songs from YouTube and play one directly from Discord, without ever opening a browser!
  - Playing music in your channel was never this easy.


- Dashboard
  - Use the web dashboard to control your bot without having to type out commands ever again.
  - You can even use your keyboard's built-in music buttons to skip songs and pause or resume playback.


- Genius Lyrics
  - Kalliope supports Genius Lyrics!
  - Quite literally actually, because they are directly accessible in Discord itself via a command.


## Commands
Kalliope uses slash commands to integrate itself into the server. You can easily access the commands directly by typing `/` in your chat window.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**

Install the latest version available.

<br/>

### Getting started

Download and install the latest version of Kalliope using git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MeridianGH/kalliope.git
cd kalliope
npm install
```

Alternatively use **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** or download as **[.zip](https://github.com/MeridianGH/Kalliope/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**.

<br/>

### Configuration
Rename or copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders inside with your info:
- A Discord Bot Token (**[Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)**)
- Your Application ID found in the `General Information` tab in your Discord application.
- Create a Genius API application **[here](https://docs.genius.com/)**, generate an access token and paste it in the config.

Run `npm run deploy` _**once**_ to synchronize the commands with Discord.\
You only need to run this during the initial setup or when you install a new update that changes some commands.


<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer"><b>Advanced: Guild Commands</b></summary>

If only want to deploy the commands as guild commands (i.e. to test command changes), run this command instead:
```
npm run deploy -- guild [guildId]
```

Use the following command to clear all global commands or only guild commands, if you provide a guild ID:
```
npm run deploy -- clear [guildId]
```

<br/>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer"><b>Optional: Lavalink</b></summary>

Install the latest version of **[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)** available.

Make sure Java is installed properly by running `java --version` in your terminal. If it displays the correct version, you are good to go!

If you are experiencing issues with age- or region-restricted videos, get your YouTube keys like described in this **[Guide](https://github.com/Walkyst/lavaplayer-fork/issues/18)**.\
Once acquired, set these tokens to `YOUTUBE_PAPISID` and `YOUTUBE_PSID` in your `.env`.

Uncomment the `localhost` node in `lavalink.ts` to make sure your bot actually connects to your Lavalink instance.\
You can use the hosted lavalink in parallel to your local instance as a redundant fallback.

<br/>

### Run
Start the bot using:
```shell
node .
```

<br>

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer"><b>Advanced: systemd unit file</b></summary>

When running Kalliope on a Linux server, chances are that you want to run it 24/7.\
If so, you'll find a sample systemd unit file in this repository.

This unit file assumes that you created a user `Kalliope` and placed this repository under `~/Kalliope/`

Copy this unit file to `/etc/systemd/user/` using following command:
```shell
sudo cp kalliope.service /etc/systemd/user/
```

Use the following commands to reload systemd and enable the service:
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
```shell
systemctl --user enable kalliope
```

Use `systemctl --user start kalliope` to start the service and `systemctl --user status kalliope` to check its status.
To view the logs use `journalctl --user-unit kalliope`.
