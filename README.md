## Disclaimer
> The bot is still in development, so expect some bugs or features that might not work 100% yet. Please report any bugs you encounter by opening an issue.


## Features
- Kalliope still offers full support for almost every platform you can imagine:
  - YouTube, Spotify, Twitch and many others!
  - It also supports playlists, livestreams and HTTP sources.
  - Spotify queries will be resolved on YouTube.


- YouTube Search
  - Search up to five songs from YouTube and play one directly from Discord, without ever opening a browser!
  - Playing music in your channel was never this easy.


- Dashboard
  - Use the web dashboard to control your bot without having to type out commands ever again.
  - You can even use your keyboard's built-in music buttons to skip songs and pause or resume playback.


- Genius Lyrics
  - Kalliope supports Genius Lyrics!
  - Quite literally actually, because they are directly accessible in Discord itself via a command.


## Commands
Kalliope uses slash commands to integrate itself into the server. You can easily access the commands directly by typing `/` in your chat window.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
- **[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)**

Install the latest versions available.\
If you encounter any issues with playback, try installing OpenJDK 13.0.2 instead of the latest Java version:

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer"><b>OpenJDK 13.0.2</b></summary>

Download the OpenJDK 13.0.2 installer either from the official **[Oracle Archive website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk13-archive-downloads.html)** (Account creation required)

**OR**

Download the binaries from the **[Java Archives](https://jdk.java.net/archive)** and unzip it to a location you can remember.

Regardless of your method, make sure to add the `/bin` folder to your path variable. If you don't know how to do that, a quick Google search will help you.

---

</details>

Make sure Java is installed properly by running `java --version` in your terminal. If it displays the correct version, you are good to go!

### Getting started

Download and install the latest version of Kalliope using git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MeridianGH/kalliope.git
cd kalliope
npm install
```

Alternatively use **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** or download as **[.zip](https://github.com/MeridianGH/Kalliope/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**.

### Configuration
Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and replace the placeholders inside with your info:
- A Discord Bot Token (**[Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)**)
- Your Application ID which you can find in the `General Information` tab in your Discord application.
- Get your YouTube keys like described in this **[Guide](https://github.com/Walkyst/lavaplayer-fork/issues/18)**. Once you have `PAPISID` and `PSID`, set them in the config.
- Create a Genius API application **[here](https://docs.genius.com/)**, generate an access token and paste it in the config.

Run `node .\deployCommands.js` _once_ to synchronize the bots commands with Discord.\
You only need to run this during the initial setup or when you install a new update that changes some commands.

### Run
Start the bot using:
```shell
node .
```
